# nanocoin-playground
This is where I share explorations with regard to Nanocoin. Nano is a digital currency which promotes three key features:
- Fee-less: Unlike more mainstream digital currencies, no amount of Nano is lost every time transactions are made
- Eco-friendly: No mining, printing, or minting. Nanocoin has very little overhead.
- Instant: It's fast.

## Current project
- [Nanocoin Wallet](https://github.com/bot1131357/nanocoin-playground/tree/main/NanoCoinWallet_v0.1)
